### **Dependencies**  

- ISO C++11 Standard (compile with `/std:c++11` or `-std=c++11`) or newer

---

### **Setup**

1. Download or copy the file ```NOUS_Multithreading.h``` into your project directory and add it to the project.
   
2. Include the header in your source files: ```#include "NOUS_Multithreading.h"```.
   
3. Refer to the usage examples and API documentation provided to start using the job system into your application.

---

### **Usage**  

#### Register the Main Thread

1. Begin by calling RegisterMainThread() to retrieve and store information about the main thread.
   
#### Initialize the Job System

2. Create and configure an instance of the NOUS_JobSystem, typically as a pointer. If no thread count is specified during initialization, the system will automatically use the maximum number of hardware threads minus one, reserving one for the main thread.
   
#### Submit Jobs

3. Once the job system is initialized, jobs can be submitted using the SubmitJob() function. Submitted jobs will be automatically queued, managed, and executed by the available worker threads.

#### Wait for Pending Jobs

4. Before shutting down the system, it is recommended to explicitly call WaitForPendingJobs() to ensure all jobs have completed. While this step is already handled in the job system‚Äôs destructor, doing it manually is considered good practice for clarity and control.

#### Shutdown and Cleanup

5. After all jobs have been processed, destroy the job system instance and call UnregisterMainThread() to clean up the main thread information.

---

### **Quick start**  
```
#include "NOUS_Multithreading.h"

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
   NOUS_Multithreading::RegisterMainThread();
   
   // Create the job system dynamically (using hardware concurrency)
   NOUS_Multithreading::NOUS_JobSystem* jobSystem = new NOUS_Multithreading::NOUS_JobSystem();
   
   // Submit jobs
   jobSystem->SubmitJob([]() { /* task 1 */ }, "Task1");
   jobSystem->SubmitJob([]() { /* task 2 */ }, "Task2");
   
   // Wait for completion
   jobSystem->WaitForPendingJobs();

   // Optional debug output
   NOUS_Multithreading::JobSystemDebugInfo(*jobSystem);
   
   // Clean up when done
   delete jobSystem;

   NOUS_Multithreading::UnregisterMainThread();
   
   return 0;
}
```

---

### `void Start(std::function<void()> func)`
Starts the thread with the specified function.

- **Parameters:**
  - `func` ‚Äî The function to be executed on the thread.
- **Note:** Does nothing if the thread is already running.

---

### `void Join()`
Joins the thread if it's joinable and marks it as no longer running.

---

### Setters and Getters

#### `void SetName(const std::string& name)`
Sets a name for the thread (for debugging purposes).

#### `const std::string& GetName() const`
Returns the thread's name.

#### `void SetThreadState(ThreadState state)`
Sets the current state (`READY`, `RUNNING`) of the thread.

#### `ThreadState GetThreadState() const`
Gets the current thread state.

#### `void SetCurrentJob(NOUS_Job* job)`
Assigns the job currently running on the thread.

#### `NOUS_Job* GetCurrentJob() const`
Returns a pointer to the currently running job, or `nullptr`.

#### `bool IsRunning() const`
Returns `true` if the thread is still active.

#### `uint16_t GetID() const`
Returns the numeric ID of the thread.

---

### Execution Time Tracking

#### `void StartExecutionTimer()`
Starts a timer to track how long the thread runs its current job.

#### `void StopExecutionTimer()`
Stops the timer after job execution ends.

#### `double GetExecutionTimeMS() const`
Returns the execution duration in milliseconds.  
If the timer is still running, returns the current elapsed time.

---

#### `void SetThreadID(std::thread::id id)`
Manually sets a thread ID using the hash of the given `std::thread::id`.

#### `static uint16_t GetThreadID(std::thread::id id)`
Generates a hashed `uint16_t` ID from a given thread ID.

---

### State Description

#### `static const std::string GetStringFromState(const ThreadState& state)`
Converts a `ThreadState` enum to a string representation (`READY`, `RUNNING`, or `UNKNOWN`).

---

### Sleep Utility

#### `static const void SleepMS(const uint32_t& ms)`
Pauses the current thread for the specified number of milliseconds.

---

## üßµ `NOUS_ThreadPool`
Manages a pool of worker threads and distributes jobs among them.

---

### `explicit NOUS_ThreadPool(uint8_t numThreads)`
Constructs a new thread pool with a specified number of worker threads.

- **Parameters:**
  - `numThreads` ‚Äî Number of worker threads to initialize.
